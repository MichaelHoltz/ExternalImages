  some notes:

always backgrounds 2 overlays background 1 in a different layer

the pink color is actually complete transparent

every background in its original size, as the viewer shows to me

World 3 - Fire Mountain Movement Background
 > Map Viewer didn't show the movement, make it yourself, please:

2 pixels left
2 pixels left
one pixel left
one normal row
then 1 pixel right
then 2 pixels right
then 2 pixels right
then 1 pixel right

after this, go down one row and repeat for movement
(something like an S curve)

Bonus 1 (the blue boxes on the upper edge) overlays DK's Arm


 the mystery of the magma...

well, the magma is 100% a background, only the first 16 tiles of it
are the "deadline" this is an animated object the rest of it is a background
when mario touch the "deadline" he dies
same goes for the needles
